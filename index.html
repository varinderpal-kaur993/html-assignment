                <p>
                    I am <strong>Varinderpal Kaur</strong>and I finished my <em>Bachelor of Computer Applications</em> from
                    India I have a keen interest in <mark>Web Designing</mark>  and my career goal is to become
                    a Web Developer like my sister and my brother-in-law who are working as Web developers
                    here in Ottawa. They are not only a source of inspiration, but they also
                    motivated me to work on small web-based projects to keep updating my GitHub
                    portfolio. Moreover, I try to capture the nature around me using my smartphone camera whenever possible. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have recently finished an online course based on <abbr title="HyperText MarkUp Language">HTML</abbr> and 
                    <abbr title="Cascading StyleSheets"> CSS </abbr> where I was
                    exposed to some advanced designing concepts like responsive web design, 
                    flexbox, and grid design along with the basics of web development. Being an 
                    Interactive Media Design student at Algonquin College, I expect to excel in 
                    both web designing and photography in general as these are not complicated as math
                     equations<mark>(a<sup>2</sup>+ b <sup>2</sup>= c<sup>2</sup>)</mark>. I am also a good listener and 
                    an active learner and always try to keep on adding to my knowledge from the web
                    articles as often as I can. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I sometimes spend too much time completing my work, usually sitting in the 
                    same posture without breaks which leads to mental fatigue. Although I am good
                    at sharing my thoughts with my teammates, being an international student,
                    I think that I need to improve my communication skills in English.
                    Furthermore, I would also like to receive any constructive and specific feedback
                    from my team to improve myself.
